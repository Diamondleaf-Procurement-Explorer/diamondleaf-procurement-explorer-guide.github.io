  <h1>Diamondleaf Public Procurement Explorer</h1>
  <p>
    This page provides orientation and guidance for understanding the analytics
    presented in the Diamondleaf Public Procurement Explorer.
  </p>

  <h2>What this explorer shows</h2>
  <p>
    The Explorer aggregates and visualizes publicly available European public
    procurement notices, enabling structured analysis across countries,
    sectors, and procurement procedures.
  </p>

  <div class="note">
    The data reflects what has been published in official procurement systems.
    It does not represent real-time contract execution or financial settlement.
  </div>

  <h2>How to read the analytics</h2>
  <p>
    Procurement processes consist of multiple notice types (e.g. planning,
    contract award, modification). Dashboards may therefore reflect different
    stages of the same procurement lifecycle.
  </p>
  <p>
    Aggregated figures should be interpreted as indicators of activity and
    structure, not as exact financial totals.
  </p>

  <h2>Navigation overview</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use filters to scope results by country, sector, or procedure</li>
    <li>Dashboards are grouped by notice and form type</li>
    <li>Hover and drill-down features reveal additional context</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Limitations & caveats</h2>
  <p>
    Public procurement data is subject to reporting practices, legal constraints,
    and publication delays. Differences between dashboards may reflect regulatory
    structure rather than inconsistencies.
  </p>
